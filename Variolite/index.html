	<p>Variolite is a package for <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> that allows programmers to locally version their code. This system appeared in CHI 2017 and got a "Best Paper Honorable Mention" for the paper: </p>

	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> <span class="abstract"><i>"How do people ideate through code? Using semi-structured
interviews and a survey, we studied data scientists who
program, often with small scripts, to experiment with data.
These studies show that data scientists frequently code new
analysis ideas by building off of their code from a previous
idea. They often rely on informal versioning interactions
like copying code, keeping unused code, and commenting
out code to repurpose older analysis code while attempting
to keep those older analyses intact. Unlike conventional
version control, these informal practices allow for fast versioning
of any size code snippet, and quick comparisons by
interchanging which versions are run. However, data scientists
must maintain a strong mental map of their code in
order to distinguish versions, leading to errors and confusion.
We explore the needs for improving version control
tools for exploratory tasks, and demonstrate a tool for
lightweight local versioning, called Variolite, which programmers
found usable and desirable in a preliminary usability
		study."</i></span></p>

	<h1>CONTINUED WORK</h1>
<p>In our lab we are continuing to study how people program to do exploratory work with data, and continuing to design new kinds of code tools. Here are some related publications so far:</p>

	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> <span class="abstract"><i>"In open-ended tasks where a program’s behavior
cannot be specified in advance, exploratory programming is a key
practice in which programmers actively experiment with different
possibilities using code. Exploratory programming is highly
relevant today to a variety of professional and end-user programmer
domains, including prototyping, learning through play,
digital art, and data science. However, prior research has largely
lacked clarity on what exploratory programming is, and what
behaviors are characteristic of this practice. Drawing on this data
and prior literature, we provide an organized description of what
exploratory programming has meant historically and a framework
of four dimensions for studying exploratory programming
tasks: (1) applications, (2) required code quality, (3) ease or difficulty
of exploration, and (4) the exploratory process. This provides
a basis for better analyzing tool support for exploratory
programming. "</i></span></p>
