			<div class = "sectionHeader"> Greetings!</div>
			<span class="personalIntro"> I am a 3rd year PhD student at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a part of the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/index.html">Natural Programming Lab</a>, and advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/">Professor Brad Myers</a>. I did my undergrad at Wellesley College, and studied computer science and art.
<p>
	  I research creativity support, particularly for exploratory programming tasks. My current work is in studying creative and exploratory programming practices, and studying individuals who perform exploratory tasks with data, such as developing machine learning models or exploratory data analysis. I aim to design tools to better support exploratory programming, particularly for end-user programmers.

The mixed-reality interface allows for designing directly onto the work surface and also aids the user in tiling the Handibot to cut areas larger than the machine cutbed. I was responsible for designing and developing the interface and computer-vision software for this project.</td>
