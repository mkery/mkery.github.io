              The City of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is home to a collection of
              public artwork placed outdoors for anyone to view free of cost,
              including an eclectic mix of statues, interactive installations,
              monuments, murals, and historic buildings.

              Researchers believe that public art improves the overall
              livability of a city. Pittsburgh is a mid-sized city with public
              art scattered among 90 distinct neighborhood communities that make
              up the city. Not only is the art distributed: the ownership,
              maintenance, and commission of pieces is also highly distributed
              between a loosely connected set of private Art institutions, Arts
              nonprofits, private citizens, and city government offices.

              <b>Problem:</b> How can the city of Pittsburgh make better use of
              its public art to improve the lives of citizens, with a diverse
              patchwork quilt of different "owners" of the art and neighborhoods
              to serve?

              With research, I sought to understand how public art in Pittsburgh
              operates, and uncover the most promising viable directions for
              connecting citizens with arts in their city.

            <span>
              First, I consulted data from a prior research project from{" "}
              <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/metro21/">
                Metro 21 Smart Cities Institute at Carnegie Mellon
              </a>{" "}
              that had tried to augment Pittsburgh public art pieces with extra
              digital online content. This data included prior interviews with
              arts stakeholders collected by that project team, as well as
              metrics on the digital content and chatbot they had deployed at
              several prominent art sites in Pittsburgh.
